![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad2556e5-dceb-48c1-bec7-4f082df78ae1)

This project provides a basic Blackjack game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It offers a stripped-down experience to focus on core gameplay.

### Getting Started

1. **Download the files:** Download the folder containing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the Blackjack game.
2. **Open the files locally:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. This will launch the Blackjack game.

### Gameplay

The game features a simple interface with two buttons:

* **START GAME:** Click this button to begin a new game. It will deal two cards to the player and one to the dealer (player cards face up, dealer card face down).
* **NEW CARD** This button allows you to draw an additional card for the player's hand. Be mindful of exceeding 21 (busting).

The game follows standard Blackjack rules:

* Cards from 2 to 10 have their face value.
* Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.
* Ace can be worth 1 or 11, depending on the player's advantage.

The player tries to get as close to 21 without going over. The dealer plays their hand after the player decides to "stand" (not draw anymore cards).

**Note:** This is a basic implementation and lacks features like dealer AI, win/loss tracking, and betting options.


### Feel free to:

* Experiment with the code! You can add functionalities like displaying card suits, dealer AI logic, and a scoring system.
* Explore online resources to learn more about building more complex web games using JavaScript and related technologies.

**Enjoy playing Blackjack!**
